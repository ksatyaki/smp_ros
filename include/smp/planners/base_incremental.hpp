  \brief Generic incremental sampling-based motion planner definition

  The generic incremental sampling-based motion planner inherits from the
  generic sampling-based motion planner and provides the virtual iteration()
  function, which is overloaded by the inheriting incremental sampling-based
  algorithm.
