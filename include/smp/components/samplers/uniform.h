  \brief The uniform sampler

  The sampler provides random samples of states that are uniformly distributed
  in
  a bounded region.

   * cube
   * centered at the origin by default.
   *
   * @param support_in New support for the uniform sampling distribution.
   *
   * @returns Returns 1 for success, a non-positive number for failure.
