   * \brief Abstract function that generates a trajectory connecting two given
   * states.
   *
   * Generates a trajectory, returned in the trajectory_out argument, that
   * connects two given states, provided with the state_from_in and
   * state_towards_in arguments. If the connection is exact, i.e., the
   * trajectory reaches state_towards_in exactly, then the output variable
   * exact_connection_out is set to one. If, on the other hand, the connection
   * is approximate, then the same variable is set to zero.
   *
   * @param state_from_in The state that the new trajectory starts from. @param
   * state_towards_in The state that the new trajectory is shooted towards.
   * @param exact_connection_out Set to one if the connection is exact,
   * otherwise this variable is set to zero by this function. @param
   * trajectory_out The output variable that contians the resulting trajectory.
   * @param intermediate_vertices_out The list of states that will be individual
   * vertices.
   *
   * @returns Returns 1 for success, a non-positive number to indicate error.
