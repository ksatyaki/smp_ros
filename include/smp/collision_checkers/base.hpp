  \brief The abstract collision checker.

  The collision checker function provides the following two functions: check
  whether
  a given state is collision-free, and check whether a given trajectory is
  collision free.
  The collision check function can be thought of as a generic check as to
  whether or not
  the new trajectory is suitable to be included in the graph.
